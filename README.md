# Grocery List App

This Grocery List app helps users(read-Moms), to make grocery lists for different stores that they would like to shop at.
Users can name the lists, add a descrption, add items then also add quanitities for each item.
They will even be able to view all items available in the stores and take a look at all stores. One feature is to list the items in a store based on price. And for Items, they can be viewed based on departments.
When a list is created the user can also checkout the prices of items on the list in other stores. The user can sign in using GitHub profile or sign up.
